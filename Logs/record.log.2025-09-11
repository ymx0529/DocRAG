-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [company, subsidiary, financial statement, employee compensation, stock option, vesting schedule, compensation plan, accounting policy, fiscal year, consolidated financial statement, actuarial valuation, future cash flow, benefit obligation, deferred compensation, equity-based compensation, earnings statement]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity output as a JSON entry with the following format:

{"name": <entity name>, "type": <type>, "description": <entity description>}

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as a JSON entry with the following format:

{"source": <source_entity>, "target": <target_entity>, "relationship": <relationship_description>, "relationship_strength": <relationship_strength>}

3. Return output in English as a single list of all JSON entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!
